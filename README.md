# Employee-Directory

This application allows for the immediate sorting of employees in any given directory. For educational purposes we use a random user API, to pull user information in lue of a legitimate database. These employees can be sorted and satisfy the following use case scenario.

Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:

1. Sort the table by at least one category.
2. Filter the users by at least one property.
